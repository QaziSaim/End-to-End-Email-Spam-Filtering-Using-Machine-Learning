# Email Spam Filtering Project

## Overview
This project aims to build an end-to-end email spam filtering system using machine learning. The goal is to classify emails as either **spam** or **non-spam** (also referred to as **ham**) by applying various classification algorithms. After testing multiple models, **Naive Bayes** was chosen as the final model due to its strong performance on this specific problem.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a well-known platform for data science and machine learning competitions. The dataset contains labeled emails, where each email is marked as either spam or ham. It includes features like email content, metadata (sender, receiver), and other relevant attributes.

### Dataset Details:
- **Number of emails**: 5,572
- **Classes**: 2 (Spam, Ham)
- **Features**: Email text data and other metadata.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   The email text data was cleaned and preprocessed to make it suitable for model training. The steps included:
   - Lowercasing all text
   - Removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters
   - Converting email text to numerical representations using techniques like **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **Bag of Words**.

2. **Model Comparison**:  
   Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model for the spam classification task. The models compared were:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - **Naive Bayes (Selected Model)**

   Performance metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** were used to evaluate these models.

3. **Naive Bayes Model**:  
   After evaluating all models, the **Naive Bayes** algorithm was chosen as the final model due to its simplicity, computational efficiency, and excellent performance on the dataset. It is particularly well-suited for text classification problems where the feature space is large and sparse.

4. **Model Evaluation**:  
   The Naive Bayes model achieved the following performance on the test data:
   - **Accuracy**: 98.5%
   - **Precision**: 97%
   - **Recall**: 99%
   - **F1-Score**: 98%
   
   These results demonstrate that the model effectively distinguishes between spam and ham emails with high precision and recall, minimizing false positives and false negatives.

5. **Deployment**:  
   The model was wrapped into a simple pipeline for ease of use. The pipeline includes steps for preprocessing incoming emails and classifying them as spam or ham using the trained Naive Bayes model. This pipeline can be deployed in any production environment for real-time email filtering.

## How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: 
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - nltk
  - matplotlib

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-filtering.git
   cd email-spam-filtering
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook spam_filtering.ipynb
   ```

4. Use the provided scripts to test and deploy the model on new email data.

## Key Insights
- **Naive Bayes** performed best for this problem due to its natural advantage in text classification tasks where features are independent and follow a probabilistic distribution.
- Proper text preprocessing and feature extraction (like using TF-IDF) significantly improve model performance.
- While other models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest provided competitive results, Naive Bayes was selected for its balance between speed and accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to effectively build and evaluate an email spam filtering system using machine learning techniques. The system is capable of identifying spam emails with high accuracy and can be easily integrated into larger email systems.

## Future Work
- Enhance feature engineering by including more metadata such as the subject line or email header information.
- Explore deep learning techniques like **RNN** or **Transformer-based models** to further improve classification accuracy.
